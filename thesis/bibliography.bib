	abstract 	= "Two formal languages are f-equivalent if their symmetric difference L1{\thinspace}∆{\thinspace}L2 is a finite set --- that is, if they differ on only finitely many words. The study of f-equivalent languages, and particularly the DFAs that accept them, was recently introduced [1]. First, we restate the fundamental results in this new area of research. Second, our main result is a faster algorithm for the natural minimization problem: given a starting DFA D, find the smallest (by number of states) DFA D{\textasciiacutex} such that L(D) and L(D{\textasciiacutex}) are f-equivalent. Finally, we present a technique that combines this hyper-minimization with the well-studied notion of a deterministic finite cover automaton [2--4], or DFCA, thereby extending the application of DFCAs from finite to infinite regular languages.",

	abstract 	= {We improve a recent result [A. Badr, Hyper-minimization in O(n2), Internat. J. Found. Comput. Sci. 20 (4) (2009) 735–746] for hyper-minimized finite automata. Namely, we present an O(nlogn) algorithm that computes for a given deterministic finite automaton (dfa) an almost-equivalent dfa that is as small as possible—such an automaton is called hyper-minimal. Here two finite automata are almost-equivalent if and only if the symmetric difference of their languages is finite. In other words, two almost-equivalent automata disagree on acceptance on finitely many inputs. In this way, we solve an open problem stated in [A. Badr, V. Geffert, I. Shipman, Hyper-minimizing minimized deterministic finite state automata, RAIRO Theor. Inf. Appl. 43 (1) (2009) 69–94] and by Badr. Moreover, we show that minimization linearly reduces to hyper-minimization, which shows that the time-bound O(nlogn) is optimal for hyper-minimization. Independently, similar results were obtained in [P. Gawrychowski, A. Jeż, Hyper-minimisation made efficient, in: Proc. 34th Int. Symp. Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, in: LNCS, vol. 5734, Springer, 2009, pp. 356–368].}
